# HCI Project – UI/UX Redesign Case Study

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project focused on evaluating and redesigning a mobile e-commerce application interface.  
The project analyzes usability problems in the original design and presents an improved UI based on established HCI and UX principles.

## Figma Design
The UI redesign was created using Figma.

## Project Objectives
- Identify usability issues in the original user interface
- Apply HCI principles to improve user experience

- Categories
- Shopping Cart
- Checkout Feedback
- Profile / Account Management

Each screen is evaluated using HCI principles such as:
- Visibility of system status
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall

## Tools Used
- Canva (UI design & presentation)
- GitHub (version control and submission)
- HCI & UX academic guidelines

## Methodology
1. Heuristic evaluation of the original interface
2. Identification of usability problems
3. UI redesign based on HCI principles
4. Comparison between "Before" and "After" designs

## Key Improvements
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Reduced visual clutter
- Improved feedback after checkout
- Better accessibility and touch targets
- Dedicated profile management
- Transparent cost breakdown in cart and checkout
